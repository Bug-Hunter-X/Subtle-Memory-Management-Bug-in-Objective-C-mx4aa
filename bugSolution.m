The issue lies in the potential for double releasing `myString` if `myString` is already autoreleased. The `retain` in the `@property` declaration already increases the retain count.  If `myString` comes from a method that already autoreleased it, releasing it again in `dealloc` will cause a double release, leading to a crash.

The solution is to use `release` only if you have previously explicitly allocated the string using `alloc` or `copy`.  Using `@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;` in modern Objective-C (ARC) eliminates this issue altogether.  If using ARC, the `dealloc` method is often unnecessary.

Here is the corrected code:

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString; // Use strong in ARC or copy in non-ARC
@end

@implementation MyClass
// dealloc is usually unnecessary in ARC
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        myObject.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@
